            In the past ten years, I have had to sit through some of the most average films that were garnering Oscar-attention to try to see what the fuss was all about. I would sit there with an open-mind trying to see, or extract, what exactly was so good about these "hyped" movies.

            Take just the last year or two for instance. As I peered hard into stuff like Roma, A Star is Born, or 3 Billboards, and similar stuff, it was like searching for a grain of sand in a field of tall grass to find what was so "classic" or special about them, compared to my four decades of watching and rewatching true greats and classics. By the time I got done, the best I could do was shrug and say, "I guess" (guess it was decent). But the truth was that none of these movies satisfied. The best you could say was that one or two scenes were good or that it was "artistic", but that doesn't mean much when there is no plot and it's just visual scenery.
